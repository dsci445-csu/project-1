## How Well Can We Classify Student Depression?

* <span style="color: blue"> **Data Set** </span>

Student Depression Dataset

* <span style="color: blue">**Data**</span>

Almost 28,000 student records with various academic, financial, and lifestyle predictors


* <span style="color: blue">**Goal**</span>

Classify student depression risk with high accuracy and interpretability 

* <span style="color: blue">**Methods Used** </span>

Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Lasso and Random Forest

## Specificities

**Categories:**

* Gender, Age, City, Academic Pressure, CGPA, Study Satisfaction, Sleep Duration, Dietary Habits, Academic Level, Have You Ever Had Suicidal Thoughts?, Financial Stress, Family History of Mental Illness, and **Depression**

* 13 Categories

* Removed ID, Profession, Work Pressure and Job Satisfaction



## Slide 2: The Results - Tanner

* <span style="color: blue">**Type II (Glutton):**</span> Eats fast, gets full quickly.
* <span style="color: red">**Type III (Learner):**</span> Slow start (learning), accelerates, then gets full.

<br>

**The Issue:** These biological behaviors look mathematically identical at high prey densities.

**The Goal:** Distinguish the correct model using the fewest experiments possible.

## Slide 3: The Results - Munisa


## Juliette Lasso

**Why Lasso:** 
Addressing Overfitting and Difficult Interpretation with Logistic Regression 
due to many large number of predictors

**The How**
* Transformed all categorical features into numeric dummy variables
* Standardized all numeric predictors so Lasso penalty will treat them equally
* Performed 5-fold CV to tune the penalty parameter, lambda. 

**The Result**
* Chose the lambda value .00174
