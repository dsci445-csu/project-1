## Slide 1: Introduction

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Statistical Challenge.png")
```


This is where we type our text. We can use:

* **Bold** for emphasis.
* Bullet points for lists.

We can just type whatever here that does not need to be bolded.

## Slide 2: The Results - Tanner

* <span style="color: blue">**Type II (Glutton):**</span> Eats fast, gets full quickly.
* <span style="color: red">**Type III (Learner):**</span> Slow start (learning), accelerates, then gets full.

**The Issue:** These biological behaviors look mathematically identical at high prey densities.

**The Goal:** Distinguish the correct model using the fewest experiments possible.
