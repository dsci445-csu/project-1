    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank Account Fraud NeurIPS 2022 datasets (called BAF for short) are a suite of synthetic datasets meant to evaluate machine learning methods. \n",
    "BAF was generated with a fraud label, a boolean value called fraud_bool, which is the response on which machine learning methods can be tested on.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal in this project is to work with various machine learning methods to get the highest recall (how many fraudulent transactions are successfully identified) possible, while locking our false positive rate (how many valid transactions are misidentified) at 5% or lower. The reason for using recall, as opposed to accuracy, is due to the nature of the dataset. There is far less fraud than legitimate transactions, and so aiming for accuracy will inherently create a model that is useless at detecting fraud."
